Allows users to put themselves to become blog authors. Widget visualization and email notifications added.

== Description ==

This plugin is useful to streamline user addition: by placing a small contact form straight in the homepage, users have a direct tool to ask becoming a website user. By the other side, admins can accept everyone with a single click, or inspect incoming requests one-by-one within the detailed table.
